# Mobility On Demand Use Cases (iOS)

This repository hosts a demo application developed in `Objective-C` exposing the usage of the **HERE iOS SDK** and **HERE REST APIs**.

The application shows how to do a basic sdk integration, use Places API and display venue map tiles.

Visit the **HERE Developer Portal** for more information on the [HERE Mobile SDKs â€“ Android & iOS](https://developer.here.com/develop/mobile-sdks) and the [HERE REST APIs & Platform Extensions](https://developer.here.com/develop/rest-apis).

> **Note:** In order to get the sample code to work, you **must** replace all instances of `YOUR_APP_ID` and `YOUR_APP_CODE` within the code and use your own **HERE** credentials.

> You can obtain a set of credentials from the [Plans](https://developer.here.com/plans) page on developer.here.com.

For more details about Mobility On Demand, visit the [HERE Mobility On Demand Toolkit](https://developer.here.com/mobility-on-demand-toolkit/documentation/topics/overview.html) page.
